# Test zstd compression library with Kotlin

This is a simple example of how to use the zstd compression library with Kotlin.
The zsdt library is a high performance compression library that can be used to compress and decompress data; it's 
lossless and supports multithreading. It was developed by Facebook as modern alternative to the zlib library.
